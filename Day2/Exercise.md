# Day 2 / Exercise

## Excercise 1
Implement a converter from meter to feet.
The user should input a number (in a EditText) representing
a distance in meter, press a button, and get the
conversion in yard (e.g. using a toast or writing the conversion
in a second EditText).

One meter is equivalent to 3.28084 foots.

## Excercise 2
Extend your application to converter from meter to feet,
inches and yards.
The user inputs the distance in meter, selects the target unit measure
(foots, inches and yards) using a Spinner, press a button, and get the
result.

One meter is equivalent to 3.28084 foots.
A foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard.

## Excercise 3
Extend your application to converter from meter, centimeters, kilometers
to feet, inches, yards and miles
The user inputs the distance, selects the source unit measure
(meter, centimeters, kilometers) using a Spinner,
selects the target unit measure
(feet, inches, yards and miles) using a Spinner,
press a button, and get the
conversion.

One meter is equivalent to 3.28084 foots.
A foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard.
5,280 feet compose a mile.

## Excercise 4
Extend your application to converter from meter, centimeters, kilometers, feet, inches, yards and miles
to meter, centimeters, kilometers, feet, inches, yards and miles.
The user inputs the distance, selects the source unit measure
(meter, centimeters, kilometers, feet, inches, yards and miles) using a Spinner,
selects the target unit measure
(meter, centimeters, kilometers, feet, inches, yards and miles) using a Spinner,
press a button, and get the
conversion.

The app should not display in the target spinner the unit measure that has been
selected as source.

## Excercise 5
Extend your application to converter distances, weights and volumes.
The user inputs the measurement,
selects the source unit measure
 using a Spinner,
selects the target unit measure
 using a Spinner,
press a button, and get the
conversion.

For distances use the following unit measures.
One meter is equivalent to 3.28084 foots.
A foot comprises 12 inches and three feet compose a yard.
5,280 feet compose a mile.

For weights use the following unit measures.
One ounce is 28.349 grams.
One pound is 16 ounces or 7000 grains.

For volume use the following unit measures.
One pint is 2 cups or 16 fluid ounces.
One gallon is 8 pints or 3.785 liters.


The app should display in the target spinner
only the unit measures compatible with the source unit.
